## Overview

Create a Lighthouse pay per view frontend experience with Shardeum.

## Requirements

Store data on IPFS:

     -with Lighthouse:
        -which requires users to pay an SHM fee on Liberty 2.1 to view the content
     -the data should be something fun to surprise someone:
     -data could be a:
        -photo
        -gif
        -video

Create a basic frontend which:

    -is hosted on IPFS/Filecoin using Fleek for easy access
    -allows user to connect Metamask wallet with a button
    -has the Lighthouse content hidden if not paid for yet
    -unlocks the Lighthouse content after paying SHM tokens on Shardeum Liberty 2.1
